Top-level scripts:

    - TEST_ALL_JASPY.sh
    - TEST_ALL_JASMIN_SCI.sh


TEST_ALL_JASPY.sh will run the following tests:

  - everything called test_*.sh, using the command: ./<filename>
  - everything called test_PT_*.py  using the command:  pytest <filename>
  - everything else called test_*.py  using the command:  python <filename>

except for:
  - everything listed in disabled_tests or jasmin_sci_tests


TEST_ALL_JASMIN_SCI.sh will run every test listed in jasmin_sci_tests
(using the same logic as above to decide how to run it)


Before running the tests, make sure that you have a working X display.
When running the test, expect some interactive questions regarding whether you saw
certain windows appear.
